# Computational Methods for Modelling Dynamic Social Behavior
**Summer Semester 2026 · University of Konstanz**

This seminar focuses on the replication and extension of computational studies using reinforcement learning to analyze and design social and economic mechanisms. It emphasizes research design and data collection through simulation-based experiments, while also engaging students in theory-driven hypothesis development and normative reflection on algorithmic governance.

## Learning Goals

- Replicate and critically evaluate published studies that use reinforcement learning and mechanism design to analyze social, economic, and political systems.
- Design, implement, and analyze extensions of existing computational models by modifying environments, reward functions, and agent architectures.
- Translate theoretical and normative concepts (e.g. cooperation, fairness, sustainability, discrimination) into operational computational frameworks and interpret their empirical implications.

## Activities & Assessment

### Reading Notes (ungraded, required)

Short written notes to support careful reading and active participation. For each core paper, students should briefly address:

- **Core contribution:** What problem does the paper address and what does it contribute?
- **Methods:** What are the key modeling or reinforcement-learning choices?
- **Questions:** What is unclear, questionable, or worth discussing?
- **Replication & extension:** Which part of the paper would you replicate or extend, and why?

These notes are **not graded**, but they are required preparation for discussion and project work.



### Discussant Role (graded, 30%)

Each student serves once as a **discussant** for one core paper.

**Responsibilities:**
- Read the assigned paper in depth (methods, design choices, assumptions).
- Identify strengths, limitations, and open questions relevant for replication.
- Frame the paper as a **starting point for future work**, not a finished product.
- Prepare a small number of slides summarizing:
  - the research question and method,
  - key design decisions,
  - concrete ideas for replication or extension.

**Format:**
- 12–15 minute presentation  
- 5–8 minutes of guided discussion with prepared prompts

The goal is to **enable replication-oriented thinking**, not to defend or critique for its own sake.



### Replication & Extension Project (graded, 70%)

The group project is the core component of the seminar. Students work in small groups to **replicate and extend** one of the course papers (or a clearly defined part of it).

**Project goals:**
- Reproduce a core result, model, or experimental setup.
- Implement a **theory-driven or design-driven extension**.
- Produce clean, reproducible research artifacts.

**Expected output:**
- A paper-style report (~8 pages / 4,000–8,000 words), including:
  - research question and motivation,
  - replication design,
  - extension and results,
  - limitations and interpretation.
- A public GitHub repository with:
  - well-documented code,
  - instructions to reproduce results,
  - clear version control.
- A **Contributions section** specifying each group member’s role.

**Deliverables & milestones:**
- Project proposal presentation (ungraded)
- Code checkpoint (ungraded)
- Writing outline checkpoint (ungraded)
- Final presentation (graded)
- Final paper and code submission (graded)

Clear communication—through writing, code, and presentations—is considered an essential part of the project.
